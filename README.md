# codecontext
An attempt to explain and group the world of software contextually

Varnish , Puppet, Mongo, LESS, SASS, Vagrant, Docker, Beautiful Soup,
Grunt, Composer, Travis, Jenkins, Laravel, Django, NPM, Angular, Ionic

To name a few of the weird and wonderful project names out there...
I have a vision of contextualising all these projects to make it easier to get a grasp on all
the great options out there..

I picture an ever updating community resource / tech wiki of sorts, but visually understandable!

What I've put together so far is a very measly D3.js concept graph that I'm hoping will spark community members into helping me
realise this goal, as I don't currently have the capacity/resources to do it alone!
